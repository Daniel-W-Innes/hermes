# Hermes

[![Go](https://github.com/Daniel-W-Innes/hermes/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Daniel-W-Innes/hermes/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

Hermes is a simple messaging service. Hermes allows the sender to post a message and specify a list of recipients. The
sender can also edit the message if required or delete the message. The recipient can check for messages. Using these
operations, messages can be sent by an individual and seen by whomever that individually selects. Hermes is built on the
Fiber framework.

## Architecture

![Generic flow for all routes](./docs/genericFlow.png)

The architecture of Hermes is designed with multiple layers of abstraction. The purpose of this design is to group
similar functions.

### Router Layer

The first layer in the architecture is the Router. The Router has multiple handlers, each of which is in charge of a
specific endpoint. These handlers are responsible for tasks related to the REST API, for example, authentication and
deserializing.

### Controller Layer

The Controller Layer contains all the business logic and conducts the appropriate action for the endpoint. The
controllers are separated from the handlers to facilitate framework independence. This also allows them to be tested
without the added complexity of the API.

### Model Layer

The Model Layer is responsible for the data objects and the functions related to manipulating the data objects. Within
the model layer, the configuration model stores the parameters required for Hermes' to be executed and the code required
to load the configuration.

### Utilities

Supporting these three layers is a set of common utilities such as the code to create database connections. This
architecture pattern closely resembles MVC but has been modified to better suit the development of an API.

## Building and Deployment

Hermes is fully Dockerized. To run Hermes, one must generate the appropriate secrets. These secrets are stored in files
in the secrets folder to be loaded into Docker secrets. It should be noted that this is not the only way of loading
Docker secrets, it is just the simplest way. After all of the secrets are in place, the application can be started using
the Docker-compose up command. This will bring up and configure PostgreSQL, along with Hermes. Hermes is configured to
listen on port 8080 by default. There is a go module file also included to allow Hermes to run without Docker.

## Testing

For the sake of time, Hermes only has the bare minimum set of tests. It has a best path test, for each API endpoint and
specialized tests for the palindrome function. These tests can be run using go test, and they are automatically run
using GitHub actions. Hermes also has some example unit tests for the add user controller. It should be noted that these
tests are not fully working. At the moment sqlmock is rolling back automatically when it should not.
